# Project Scaffold

A minimal, accessible starting point for early course exercises.

## Files

-   index.html — HTML5 skeleton with a header, main, and footer
-   styles.css — Basic typography and layout resets

## How to use

1. Open `index.html` in VS Code
2. Start Live Server (status bar: "Go Live")
3. Edit content under the About and Links sections

## Tips

-   Keep a single `<h1>` per page
-   Use meaningful link text (avoid “click here”)
-   Validate HTML with the W3C validator when in doubt
