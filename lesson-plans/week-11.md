# Week 11 — ES6+ & Async JavaScript (Index)

This week covers modern JavaScript features (ES6+) and asynchronous programming patterns.

## Overview

-   Focus: ES6+ features, arrays, objects, and asynchronous JavaScript
-   Outcomes:
    -   Use modern ES6+ syntax and features
    -   Work with arrays and objects effectively
    -   Understand asynchronous JavaScript concepts
    -   Use Promises and async/await
